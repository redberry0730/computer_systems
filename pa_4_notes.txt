Dot Product

v = <a, b, c>
w = <d, e, f>

v * w = a * d + b * e + c * f


Matrix Product

A
a b
c d

B
e f
g h

C
(a * e + b * g)   (a * f + b * h)
(c * e + d * g)   (c * f + d * h)

C[i,j] = A[i] * B[j]



for i in [0, dim)
  for j in [0, dim) 
    C[i, j] = A[i] * B[j]

for i in [0, dim)
  for j in [0, dim) 
    C[i, j] = 0
    for k in [0, dim)
      C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]


Transposition:

a b
c d  -->

a c

a b c d        a e i m
e f g h  -->   b f j h
i j k l        c g k o
m n o p        d h l p


Indexing where a matrix is represented as a single-dimensional ("flat") array:

c[i][j] --> c[i * dim + j]

The matrix rows are stored in ROW-MAJOR ORDER:
array c holds row 0, followed by row 1, etc.  Each
row has length dim.

In "i * dim + j", the "i * dim" get you to the right row,
and the "+ j" gets you to the right column within that
row.
